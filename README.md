### What I Learned

This project was a bit of a challenge. The hardest part to figure out was the dropped column. Most of the base styles
were set using css variables for things like fonts, text sizing, and font weights. I used CSS Grid to create the team
grid, but to get the second colum to drop I used the `:nth-child()` property. I used Flexbox for the header to get the
nice spacing on desktop.

In time, I hope to do some refactoring to make the code more readable and maintainable.
